    <p>>The following link: http://ciml.info/ is rated a beginner reading material by https://github.com/chaconnewu/free-data-science-books and since I don't have any experience with Machine Learning (as of this date: 8/31/2022), I will love to learn machine learning and apply it to my data analytics toolbox.</p>
